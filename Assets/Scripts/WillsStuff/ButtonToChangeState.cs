/// <summary>
/// 
/// Written by William Holman, October-November 2018.
/// 
/// This uses the VRStandardAssets VRInteractiveItem class. I've explained what I've come to learn about the VRStandardAssets classes in the programmer readme in the git repo. 
/// 
/// This will get activated when the object this is attached to is double clicked on, using the touch pad. 
/// 
/// This class is used for a variety of reasons.
/// There are three uses for it.
/// 
/// 1. Changing canvases
///     if UsesCanvases is ticked, it will try to get the CanvasController component on the main camera.
///     it will then attempt to call the change canvas and state function, if the component exists.
///     this was for swapping between canvases in front of the camera, however this functionality in the simulation was removed because it was no longer wanted.
///     I decided to leave it in, just in case it's wanted again.
///     
/// 2. Setting difficulty.
///    if setDifficulty is ticked, it will attempt to set the difficulty on the global state manager.
///    There are two difficulties at the time of writing this, Assisted and Un-Assisted.
///    Assisted allows an icon to pop up that indicates what you are looking at.
///    Un-Assisted has no indicators when looking at inspectable objects. 
///    
/// 3. Loading Scenes
///    if loadScene is ticked, it will attempt to load the specified scene (through int value)
///    
/// 
/// ADDENDUM: ammended by David McCann May 2019, because who uses double tap when you can just click like a normal person.
///
