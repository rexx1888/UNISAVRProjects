Ok, so this is whats gon go down homie g

Now listen up boyo/girly,they dont teach this at AIE so pay attention.
Im using a method where i bake lighting directly onto textures using substance painter, so highpoly to lowpoly workflow is still used although only a single diffuse texture is output. (woah spooky texture magic)
Tutorial demonstration i found on yt here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHQfYklBVTY

The teachers are expecting you to continue making high quality assets in a realistic art style for a mobile device, so this method is the the most efficient way.
(additionally,since you will be using a 360 image as the environment only one inspectable object will be on-screen at any one point in time so assets can be quite detailed with 512 or 1024 textures (but keep in mind its still a mobile device >.>)

As for the unity scene, no lighting is required (because its baked onto textures) just ramp up the ambient intensity so assets are lit from any angle.
(remember to use mobile shader)

k then bye (>^-^)>
