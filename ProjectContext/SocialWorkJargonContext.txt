Re strengths and challenges, I'll attempt to briefly describe them here and give examples:

Strengths-evidence of child focused parenting that enhances the child's life I.e. toys, children's books, bedroom furnished with child in mind.

Challenges-anything that may pose a risk to the child or indicate neglect-I.e. knife on floor, pill bottles, alcohol bottles that may suggest heavy drinking, unhygienic living spaces.
